# Installation

Problems with installation? Check the [FAQ](../faq).

The automatic installer for your operating system should work for the majority of people. If you’re using a school computer that disallows installing programs, or have other issues with the installer, you can use the instructions below to perform a manual installation. Then, make sure to read the section on [Security](./security).

## Manual Installation

### PC

First, download the latest “Standalone” template (Debate.dotm) from the downloads page. Make sure that the file is saved as “Debate.dotm” and not “Debate (1).dotm” if you have accidentally downloaded more than one copy.

Then, move Debate.dotm to your Templates folder, usually located at:
c:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates

You can type `%APPDATA%` into the address bar of a Windows Explorer window to get most of the way there.

That’s it, Verbatim is installed! For ease of use, create a “shortcut” to Debate.dotm on your desktop (not a copy of the file itself).

### Mac

First, download the latest “Standalone” template (Debate.dotm) and the latest Script file (Verbatim.scpt) from the downloads page. Make sure that the files are saved e.g. as “Debate.dotm” and not “Debate (1).dotm” if you have accidentally downloaded more than one copy.

To perform a manual installation on the Mac, you just need to put Debate.dotm and Verbatim.scpt in the appropriate folders. Note that these folders may be hidden by default, so you can use Cmd+Shift+G to go directly to the locations listed before.

For Mac Word 2016 and later, Debate.dotm should be placed in:
```
~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates
```

Verbatim.scpt should be placed in:
```
~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Word/
```

Note that you may need to manually create the `com.microsoft.Word` folder for Verbatim.scpt – be careful to use the exact punctuation and capitalization above!
