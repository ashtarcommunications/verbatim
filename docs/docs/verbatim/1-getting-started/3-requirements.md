# Requirements

Verbatim 6 requires a full desktop version of Word with support for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Macros. Almost all recent versions of Office (PC or Mac) will work fine.

It was designed using Word 2019+/Office 365. It likely works with Word 2016 or even earlier versions, but hasn't been thoroughly tested with earlier versions.

## Incompatible Office versions

The following versions of Word/Office will NOT work with Verbatim:
* Office Online (in the web browser)
* Microsoft App Store versions of Office
* Office for iPad
* Office for Android
* Office 2010 "Starter Pack"
* Office RT for Surface RT Tablet
* Office LTSC versions, if significantly out of date
* Mac Word 2008
* Mac Word 2011
