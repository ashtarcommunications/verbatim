# Installation

To download the latest version, see [paperlessdebate.com](https://paperlessdebate.com)

Problems with installation? Check the [FAQ](../faq).

Getting a virus alert? See [Verbatim and Antivirus](./virus).

Note that the current Mac installer may or may not work on Apple Silicon devices - we're working on a new version of the installer to support both. In the interim, if the installer fails on your device, use the manual installation instructions below.

## Automated Installation

The automatic installer for your operating system should work for the majority of people. Then, make sure to read the section on [Security](./security) to understand how to adjust your macro security settings for use with Verbatim.

On a PC, you also likely want to download the Plugins installer to automatically install all Verbatim [plugins](../advanced/plugins) at once, including the Vebratim Timer, OCR, search and more.

On Mac, you may need to allow the installer to run as an unidentified developer. After running the installer, go to the apple menu, System Preferences - Privacy & Security, and grant an exception for the Verbatim installer.

For more detailed instructions, see:

https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac

After running the automated installer, you can open Verbatim with the shortcut on your Desktop (or Start Menu/Applications folder). Or, you can open Word and select "New from Template" to open a file based on the "Debate" template.

You may also run one of the Setup Check tools described in the section on [Security](./security) to ensure you've installed Verbatim correctly, and to help you manage your macro security settings.

## Manual Installation

If you’re using a school computer that disallows installing programs, or have other issues with the installer, you can use the instructions below to perform a manual installation.

Because Verbatim is a template for Word, to "install" it you just need to ensure the template files are placed in the correct folders. There are only 2 important files (3 on Mac):

Debate.dotm - this must be placed in your Office "Templates" folder.
DebateStartup.dotm - this must be placed in your Office "STARTUP" folder.
Verbatim.scpt (Mac only) - must be placed in your Application Scripts folder.

### PC

First, download the latest template files, `Debate.dotm` and `DebateStartup.dotm`, from the downloads page. Make sure that the files are saved as e.g. “Debate.dotm” and not “Debate (1).dotm” if you have accidentally downloaded more than one copy.

1) Move `Debate.dotm` to your Templates folder, usually located at:

`c:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\`

You can type `%APPDATA%` into the address bar of a Windows Explorer window to get most of the way there.

If you'd also like to install Verbatim Flow for Excel, put a copy of the `Debate.xltm` template in your Templates folder as well.

2) Move `DebateStartup.dotm` to your STARTUP folder, usually located at:

`c:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP\`

That’s it, Verbatim is installed! For ease of use, create a “shortcut” to Debate.dotm on your desktop (not a copy of the file itself).

### Mac

First, download the latest template files, `Debate.dotm` and `DebateStartup.dotm`, and the Verbatim script file `Verbatim.scpt` from the downloads page. Make sure that the files are saved as e.g. “Debate.dotm” and not “Debate (1).dotm” if you have accidentally downloaded more than one copy.

Note that the following folders may be hidden by default, so you can use `Cmd+Shift+G` to go directly to the locations listed.

1) Move Debate.dotm to your Templates folder, usually located at:

`~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates/`

If you'd also like to install Verbatim Flow for Excel, put a copy of the `Debate.xltm` template in your Templates folder as well.

2) Move DebateStartup.dotm to your Startup folder, usually located at:

`~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Startup/Word/`

3) Move `Verbatim.scpt` to:

`~/Library/Application Scripts/com.microsoft.Word/`

You may need to manually create the `com.microsoft.Word` folder for Verbatim.scpt – be careful to use the exact punctuation and capitalization above.
