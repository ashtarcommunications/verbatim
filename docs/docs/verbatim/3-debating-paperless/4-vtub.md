The Virtual Tub allows you to select a Block from a menu of files in the Ribbon and insert it right into your current document, without having to open the source file.

To use the VTub, open the Verbatim Settings and go to the VTub tab. Click “Browse” and find the folder of files you want in your VTub, then click the “Create VTub” button. Wait, probably for a really long time.

Eventually you should get a message that the creation was successful – then, if you select the Virtual Tub menu on the ribbon, you should get a menu of all the files in the tub. 

Selecting any file will open up a menu with the Headings contained in the file. Digging down through the menus until you find a “Block,” clicking on the name of the Block will insert it at the current insertion point.

 
Cautionary Notes
•	The VTub will display the internal heading structure of the file down to the Heading 3/Block level – so it can only be used to paste in a Block at a time, not individual cards or larger sections. This is by design, since including every card in the menu would be unworkable. If a file appears in the menu completely grayed out, odds are that it doesn’t include any Headings formatted as “Block.”
•	The VTub probably won’t work with an entire tub worth of files. It’s really only designed for a handful of select files that you want readily accessible (Theory, 2AC Blocks, Politics 2NC’s, etc…). The more files you try and throw at it, the more likely it will fail.
•	The VTub does better with smaller files – if you’re trying to use a 2MB case neg and it fails, try using smaller files.
•	The VTub Creator will take a long time, especially if you have more than a few files. It will eventually finish, but taking several minutes is to be expected.
•	If you make any changes to the structure of the files in the VTub, you run the risk of having it not work right. Highlighting shouldn’t affect it, but if you move blocks around you should regenerate the tub by selecting “Recreate VTub” from the menu.
•	Using the Virtual Tub will conflict with the “Use NavPaneCycle at Startup” option – you should disable this if you are going to use the VTub.
