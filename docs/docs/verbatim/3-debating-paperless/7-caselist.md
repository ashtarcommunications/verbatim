Caselist
Verbatim has several built-in functions to make intel sharing easier.

Cite Requests
Verbatim has two built-in macros which make converting cards into a “cite-request ready” format with the tag, cite, and first/last sentence easy. 

To convert a single card, place your cursor in the card and select “Cite Request” or use Ctrl+Q. This will eliminate everything in the text of the card except the first and last few words of the card.

To convert the entire document to a cite-request format, select “Cite Request Doc.” This will open a new document with the results of the conversion.

Wiki Functions
“Convert to Wiki” – this option will open a new document and convert everything to cites in ready-to-post wiki syntax for openCaselist, . This should help avoid many of the formatting errors people make. Note that this step is unnecessary if using the built-in “uploader” described next, as the same functionality is built-in.

The “openCaselist” button is the best integrated solution for posting cites to the caselist. It will automatically upload the current document either as cites or as an open source Speech document (or both) to the caselist. It does the cite/wiki conversions for you, so you don’t even need to convert them manually before upload. Just click the button from your document full of cards to upload, and you’re done.
