The Desktop

It helps to conceptualize your desktop like a desk which moves workflow from left to right.  Starting with the taskbar along the left side, which keeps the open documents organized, try to use approximately the left half of your screen for all the open files.  Then, keep Speech open on the right side of your screen.  Even if you can’t fit two windows open side by side on your desktop, try to leave a little bit that doesn’t overlap. This enables you to rapidly switch between documents and your Speech doc without digging through a host of open windows.

You should also consider moving the Windows taskbar to the left side of the screen, rather than the bottom.  Usually this is accomplished by right clicking on it and unchecking “Lock the Taskbar,” then dragging it to the left side of the screen.  This is so that you can more easily see a large number of word documents open without the taskbar grouping them.  The taskbar can then also be resized horizontally to take up more or less screen space.
 

Clear the desktop of non-essential items.  Since the desktop is frequently used to save Speech documents and copy them to the USB drive, it’s helpful to have it cleared of extraneous files.  Useful things to keep on the desktop include: A folder with the most recent tub, a shortcut to Verbatim, a folder for the current tournament, and a shortcut to your external USB drive.  See the screenshot above for a sample layout.
Toolbars
Add your digital tub folder as a toolbar to the taskbar.  To do this, right click on the toolbar, select “Toolbars – New Toolbar” and then navigate to the folder which contains your digital tub.  This will create a toolbar with immediate access to all of your files.  It can be dragged to show icons, or collapsed so that clicking one arrow will bring up a directory listing of all the folders in your tub.  You can even create multiple toolbars for different folders, such as one for backfiles, one for current files, and one for the affirmative.  A helpful tip – holding down “shift” while clicking to open a file will keep the taskbar open, rather than closing it and forcing you to re-click through the levels of a tub.  This is very helpful when opening more than one document at a time.
Operating System Tweaks
Turn off updates.  It’s recommended that you temporarily turn off any program which will try to update itself automatically, including Windows Update, just for the duration of the round (or the tournament).  This is to avoid the computer trying to reboot itself automatically, or popping up annoying reminders about updates in the middle of a speech.

Turn off hibernation/standby/screen savers.  You should set your computer to never go into sleep mode, hibernate, or turn the screen off, including when the lid is shut.  This is usually accomplished by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting “Properties.”  The power settings are included on the Screen Saver tab, under the “Power” button.

Turn off any programs which could interfere with using the macros by utilizing “hot-keys.”  Some programs running in the background of your computer may already have assigned certain keystrokes that are used by the paperless macro.  A prominent example is certain NVidia graphics cards which assign hotkeys which rotate the screen.  This can be turned off by right-clicking the desktop, selecting “Graphics Properties – Hot Keys” – and selecting “Disable Hot Keys.”  Other programs may also exhibit similar behavior – if macros aren’t behaving correctly, check your computer for other hidden programs which might have hot-keys.

Consider a separate user account for paperless.  Since most people will not want their screen set up the same way for every day use as for paperless, consider adding a separate account in Windows used exclusively for debate.  This will allow you to set up the desktop to your specifications without interfering with everyday work.


Document Navigation
Use “Draft” view.  This removes the header, footer, and extraneous white space from your document view.  It’s better than Web view in my opinion because it doesn’t make the text unreadably long horizontally.

Use the Navigation Pane– Most of you will be familiar with this from creating files electronically.  In paperless debate, its importance is elevated even further.  It functions like an index, allowing you to see the entire file at once – and makes moving around within a file substantially faster.  It also enables you to see where you’re moving blocks to while using MoveUp and MoveDown.  I’d recommend leaving the Nav Pane turned on in all documents, at all times.  

Use the mouse wheel to zoom – On many computers, holding down the Ctrl key while scrolling the mouse wheel will cause Word to zoom in and out quickly.  This can help you see more of the document or an individual card easily, especially if you’re working on a smaller screen.

You can cycle through all open Word docs using the “Windows” button on the ribbon (Ctrl-Tab).
Reading Mode
Use “Full Screen Reading” view when actually giving your speech.  There’s a convenient button for it on the taskbar.  This view will allow you to see one or two entire pages at a time, and quickly move through your document by using the arrow keys to move a page at a time, instead of scrolling or using Page Down.  If only one page is visible, try shrinking the size of the document map horizontally until two pages appear.  

When in Full Screen Reading view, the `/~ key instead functions as a “Speech Marker.”  Clicking in a card where you stopped reading and pressing the `/~ key will insert a marker (pictured right). To return to the “one-page-at-a-time” scroll mode, either press Esc, or use your mouse wheel.
 

IMPORTANT NOTE: To turn on the Navigation Pane in Reading View, click the “Page x of y” button in the center of the screen.

Quick Access Toolbar

By default, Word 2010 displays the Quick Access Toolbar ABOVE the ribbon.  This is a bad place for it.  To move it below the ribbon, right-click and select “Show Below The Ribbon.”

You also might want to clear the QAT of any default buttons.  Word usually has a few at the far left that appear before the custom Verbatim functions (underlined in Red).  
Once you have the shortcut keys memorized, you probably won’t need to constantly be looking at the Debate tab in the ribbon.  To hide it, double click the title.  Then, you can just use the Quick Access Toolbar.  Double-click to restore it.

Pre-tournament Setup
This is a pre-tournament checklist to make sure you’re ready to debate paperless.  Mostly, it’s just a distillation of the preceding advice.

Drills, drills, drills – Most paperless difficulties are the exclusive product of a lack of practice.  While memorizing the hotkeys and understanding the basic elements only takes 5 minutes, becoming proficient enough to deal with contingencies or be extremely quick takes hours.  While this is a significant time investment, it’s useful to remember the amount of time saved vs. hand-labeling manila folders and printing expando indexes.

Make sure you have enough laptops – As mentioned above, I think each team needs a minimum of three laptops.  It’s probably also a good idea for the team at large to have some backups, as debaters seem to be kryptonite to technology.

Check that each computer works – debaters seem to have a knack for ensuring that any computer purchased one night will be infected with a virus, rife with spyware, and running too slowly to effectively open multiple Word documents before the morning arrives.

Clean off the desktop and USB drives.  Since the desktop is used as a work space where Speech files are saved and copied, digital tubs are kept, etc...It’s a good idea to clear everything else off, at least for the duration of a tournament.  If there’s an inordinate amount of clutter, it can just be temporarily stored in a new folder.  It’s also a good idea to create a folder for each tournament, so you can store (and label) Speech documents and update files as they are produced.  It’s also a good idea to start with a clean USB drive before each round – this both ensures there’s not confusion over which file to open, and prevents the accidental spread of either viruses or previous files.

Make sure each laptop has the most recent version of the digital tub.  While archived backfiles can be put on each computer at the beginning of the season and left relatively untouched, the master copy of the digital tub is constantly in flux.  It’s a good idea to have a complete copy on a USB drive before leaving for the tournament, just in case one (all) of the debaters forget to update their local copies.

Make sure each computer is set up for paperless – toolbars created, hibernation/screen saver turned off, updates turned off, screen rotation turned off, etc.
