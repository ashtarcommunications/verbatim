# Paperless Debate Manual

This site contains documentation for [Verbatim](https://paperlessdebate.com) and associated tools.

![Verbatim Ribbon](./verbatim/assets/ribbon.png)

Verbatim is a free, open-source (GPL3) platform for paperless debate, with a variety of supporting tools and plugins. The desktop version is built as a template for Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. It's primarily designed for usage in US-based high school and collegiate policy debate, but is usable by many other debate formats including Lincoln-Douglas, Public Forum, etc.

Verbatim also comes with a built-in tutorial to teach you how to use it. But if youâ€™re looking for more advanced instruction and tips, the online manual will walk you through every feature.

For more information or to download the latest version, see the [Paperless Debate](https://paperlessdebate.com) homepage.

To get started, follow the [Installation](verbatim/getting-started/installation) instructions.
