Verbatim 6 has been rewritten from scratch to be cross-platform, with many new features and bug fixes. Here are some of the highlights:

* Combined the Mac and PC versions of Verbatim into a single cross-platform code base, and brought Mac Verbatim very close to feature parity with the PC version, including an improved Ribbon interface
* New setup tools for both PC and Mac to help manage your macro security settings and system tweaks to better prepare your system for use with Verbatim
* Verbatim installers are now "secure by default," making them easier to work with school IT departments and less likely to have false positive virus alerts

* A new Verbatim Flow template for flowing in Excel, integrated with Verbatim in Word making it easy to move arguments between your speech and your flow and vice versa
* A new Quick Cards feature to speed adding commonly used cards and analytics to your speech
* New cross-platform Virtual Tub that handles refreshes faster
* Integrations with the new opencaselist.com and Tabroom, making disclosing to the caselist easier than ever

* Better handling for rapid switching between pilcrow modes when condensing text
