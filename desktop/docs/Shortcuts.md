Keyboard shortcuts are the best way to improve your efficiency using Verbatim

Below are the built-in defaults for keyboard shortcuts. Note that the Ctrl key is used on PC, while the Command key is used on the Mac.

Shortcuts can be customized in the Verbatim settings. The F-key shortcuts can choose from a list of macros, or you can use the Advanced settings to change any shortcut.

To help in remembering the shortcuts, here are a few general guidelines:

Shorcuts with "Alt" + a key are usually an "alternate" way of doing the function for the main key. For example, F3 condenses text, while Alt + F3 condenses text without pilcrows.

Shortcuts with "Ctrl" + a key are usually a way of automating or running a macro associated with the function for the main key. So F8 is cite style, while Ctrl + F8 auto-formats your citation.

Shortcuts using the `/~ key are for "sending" content to different locations, both in Word and Verbatim Flow in Excel.

Shortcuts with Ctrl + Alt + <letter> are usually named with the first letter representing the function.
